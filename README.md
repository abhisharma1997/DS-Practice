Question 1 : Subarray with given sum
    Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers,
    find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
    In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.
    
    I/P -> Please enter size of Array :
            5
            43
            23
            54
            65
            92
            Please enter required sum from Array :
            142
    O/P ->  [2, 4]

Question 2 : Missing number in array.
            Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.
            
    
            I/P ->  N = 5
                    A[] = {1,2,3,5}
            Output: 4

Question 3 : Find duplicates in an array.
            Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1,
            you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array.

        
            Input:
                N = 4
                a[] = {0,3,1,3}
            Output: 
                [3]

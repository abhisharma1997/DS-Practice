Question 1 : Subarray with given sum
    Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers,
    find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
    In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.
    
    I/P -> Please enter size of Array :
            5
            43
            23
            54
            65
            92
            Please enter required sum from Array :
